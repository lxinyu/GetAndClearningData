This s repository for the course project for "Get And Cleaning Data" course in Coursera. The project description linked here: https://class.coursera.org/getdata-014/human_grading/view/courses/973501/assessments/3/submissions 

There is only one script file which is run_analysis.R, linked here: 
https://github.com/lxinyu/GetAndClearningData/blob/master/run_analysis.R 

The script does the following steps 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
